# @1delta-x/solvers

Off-chain filler / solver reference implementations for `UniversalSettlement`.

These contracts are permissionless fillers: anyone may run one to fill an order.
They hold no funds between fills — each fill sources its collateral inventory
from a flash-loan provider, routes it through Settlement to satisfy the order,
swaps the borrow proceeds back to the collateral asset, and repays the flash in
the same transaction. The shared fill → swap → repay machinery lives in
`base/BaseFlashSolver.sol`; each concrete solver only differs in which flash
provider it draws inventory from.

## Layout

`src/` is grouped by **fill shape** — the order shape each solver fills:

- **`base/`** — `BaseFlashSolver.sol`, the shared abstract base.
- **`single-input/`** — solvers for single debt-leg leverage orders. One per
  flash provider:
  - `LimitOrderLeverageSolver.sol` — **Balancer v2** (defines `IBalancerVault`)
  - `AaveV3FlashSolver.sol` — **Aave v3** (defines `IAaveV3Pool`)
  - `MorphoFlashSolver.sol` — **Morpho Blue** (defines `IMorphoFlash`)
  - `EulerFlashSolver.sol` — **Euler EVK** (defines `IEulerFlashVault`)
- **`multi-input/`** — solvers for multi-input orders (several `tokenIn` legs,
  e.g. a dual conversion where borrow proceeds and maker equity both flow to the
  solver):
  - `MultiInputLeverageSolver.sol` — **Balancer v2**
  - `AaveV3MultiInputFlashSolver.sol` — **Aave v3**
  - `MorphoMultiInputFlashSolver.sol` — **Morpho Blue**
  - `EulerMultiInputFlashSolver.sol` — **Euler EVK**
- **`multi-output/`** — solvers for multi-output orders:
  - `MultiOutputFlashSolver.sol` — **Balancer v2**

The single-input Aave/Morpho/Euler solvers each define the provider interface
(`IAaveV3Pool`, `IMorphoFlash`, `IEulerFlashVault`); their multi-input
counterparts import it from the single-input file. Balancer's `IBalancerVault`
is defined in `LimitOrderLeverageSolver.sol` and reused by the other Balancer
solvers.
